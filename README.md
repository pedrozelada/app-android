# Overview
As a software engineer, Iâ€™m always looking to expand my skill set and build real-world applications using modern tools and architectures. For this project, I wanted to deepen my understanding of Kotlin and Jetpack Compose, while also preparing to integrate cloud database technologies like Firebase Firestore.

This app, ScheduleManagerApp, is a productivity tool that helps users manage their academic schedules. Users can add courses, tasks, exams, and view their weekly timetable all in one place. The app ensures time conflicts are avoided and data is validated to prevent user errors. It is designed to be intuitive and efficient for students or professionals managing complex schedules.

The purpose of creating this app was to strengthen my experience with modern Android development patterns, including MVVM architecture, state management, and Jetpack Compose UI toolkit, while also preparing the groundwork for cloud integration.
