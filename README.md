# ScheduleManagerApp

ScheduleManagerApp is a productivity-focused Android app built using modern Kotlin and Jetpack Compose. It helps users manage academic schedules by adding and organizing courses, assignments, exams, and weekly timetables efficiently.

## âœ¨ Purpose
As a software engineer, Iâ€™m always looking to expand my skill set and build real-world applications using modern tools and architectures. This project deepened my understanding of Kotlin and Jetpack Compose while preparing me to work with Firebase technologies like Firestore and Authentication.

## ðŸ§  Features
- Add and manage **courses**, **tests**, **assignments**, and **class schedules**
- Automatically prevents time conflicts when scheduling
- Persistent cloud storage using **Firebase Firestore**
- **User login and registration** with Firebase Authentication
- Offline access with Room (optional fallback architecture)
- MVVM architecture with ViewModel and StateFlow
- Clean UI powered by **Jetpack Compose** and Material3
